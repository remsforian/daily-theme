#Daily Theme Tracking

This program is designed to track your yearly theme on a daily basis. Right now it is just writing to the csv file, but I am hoping to make some visualization tools at some point.

How to use:

If you have been using this code already **save the csv file** this is very important. Otherwise you may loose all of your existing data!

Run ``` git pull https://github.com/remsforian/daily-theme.git ``` in the terminal

When you want to do your daily sumbissions run ```python3 entry.py``` when you are in the Daily Theme Directory

That's it! You will need to use the terminal for this. If you are new to using the terminal. Don't worry about it if you are new, I promice it isn't all that complicated. If you need any help don't hesitate to reach out.
